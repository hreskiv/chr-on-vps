# CHR on VPS

**Bash script to automatically install MikroTik Cloud Hosted Router (CHR) on a VPS.**  
It downloads and extracts the official CHR image, injects an autorun script with network configuration (IP + gateway taken from the host Linux) and admin password, writes the image to the VPS disk, and reboots.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This script completely overwrites the system disk. Use only on fresh VPS instances.

---

## Features

- Downloads the official MikroTik CHR image (**default 7.19.4**).
- Extracts the `.img` file from the `.zip` package.
- Mounts the image and injects an `autorun.scr` into the `rw/` partition:
  - Configures static IP and gateway from the current Linux VPS.
  - Sets the admin password (`NEW_PASSWORD`).
  - Sets system identity (`IDENTITY`).
- Uses Linux `sysrq` (`u`, `s`, `b`) for safe remount, sync, and reboot.
- Works on **Debian/Ubuntu** and **CentOS/RHEL** VPS.
- Tested on DigitalOcean
